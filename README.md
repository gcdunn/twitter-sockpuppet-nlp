## Using natural language processing to profile nefarious Twitter 'sockpuppet' accounts

Millions of tweets.  Thousands of fake accounts.  A sophisticated disinformation campaign.

The Internet Research Agency and other nefarious operators famously used Twitter ['sockpuppet'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_(Internet)) accounts and other social media platforms to interfere with public opinion regarding the 2016 United States presidential election.  This was not the first, nor will it be the last, attempt to use social media to undermine the democratic process.  Propaganda accounts simultaneously launched disinformation campaigns stoking division regarding Brexit in the United Kingdom and civil war in Ukraine.  A [study](http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/cybertroops2018/) conducted at the University of Oxford states that at least 48 countries experienced manipulative social media influence campaigns in 2017.  Additionally, it is notoriously difficult to identify the deceptive work of a sophisticated disinformation campaign, as demonstrated by work of Keith Collins and Sheera Frenkel at the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/04/technology/facebook-influence-campaigns-quiz.html).  These fake accounts skillfully impersonated individuals, political organizations, and news sources.

#### Some questions I intend to answer:
* How did fake accounts interact with each other?  How did they interact with real accounts?

* When were these accounts created?  How did the number of tweets evolve over time?  Did any spikes on these tweets synchronize with important events leading up to the election?

* What topics were these accounts tweeting about?

* Which politicians, media persons, locations, or organizations are mentioned?

* How do the sentiments of tweets about different named entities (for example, politicians or political movements) compare?

* How do these fake accounts cluster according to tweet content?

* How does the retweeted content compare to original content?

* What types of voices were amplified through retweets?
